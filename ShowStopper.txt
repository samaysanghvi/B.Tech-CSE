1) Data Login
2) Z-Coordinate for location
3) Biometric

Reasons :

1) Data Login - Suppose student does not have internet connection or wifi is not working , in order to mark himself as present, he/she will press button for marking him present , but when internet is active on his mobile , at that time this request will be sent and responded accordingly.

2) Z- Coordinate - Suppose class is conducted in ground floor class room and there is a class room exactly above this room , since both have same x-y coordinates , we need a z-coordinate to distinguish both roooms.

3) Biometric - Needed to verify that student himself requests for marking him present and not his friend.
